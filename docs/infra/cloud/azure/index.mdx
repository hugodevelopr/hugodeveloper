# Guides

Guides are **implementation-focused**.

The goal is simple: you should be able to take a guide and apply it to a real system without guessing the missing pieces.

## What you’ll find here

- Patterns implemented end-to-end (not just theory)
- Code-level details with operational considerations
- Checklists you can use during implementation and review

## My guide template

Each guide follows a consistent structure:

1) **Context & problem**
2) **Constraints**
3) **Approach**
4) **Implementation notes**
5) **Testing strategy**
6) **Operational concerns**
7) **Trade-offs**
8) **Checklist**

## Start points

If you’re not sure what to read:
- Pick a topic you’re currently implementing (messaging, reliability, authn/authz, observability)
- Use Reference to refresh concepts, then come back here
