# Reference

This section is my **engineering glossary + mental models**.

When I publish Guides and Deep Dives, I link back here so you can refresh concepts fast.

## What belongs in Reference

- Definitions that are easy to get wrong (idempotency, delivery semantics, consistency)
- Short mental models (when to use which pattern)
- Pitfalls and “gotchas” that don’t deserve a full deep dive

## How to use it

- Read it when you want clarity quickly
- Treat it as supporting material for Guides and Deep Dives
- Link to it when discussing architecture with your team
