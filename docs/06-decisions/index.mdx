# Decisions

This is my public record of engineering decisions — **mini-ADRs**.

The purpose isn’t to look smart. The purpose is to show:
- judgment under constraints
- trade-offs made consciously
- alternatives considered fairly
- how I reduce ambiguity for teams

## Format

Each decision includes:

- **Context**: what’s happening, why now
- **Decision**: what we chose
- **Options considered**: at least 2–3 real options
- **Trade-offs**: pros/cons and what we’re optimizing for
- **Consequences**: what this changes, risks introduced
- **How to validate**: what metrics/signals prove it was right

## Decision template (copy/paste)

**We will** …

## Options considered
### Option A: …
- Pros:
- Cons:
- When it’s the right choice:

### Option B: …

## Trade-offs
What we optimize for, and what we deliberately accept.

## Consequences

## Validation
