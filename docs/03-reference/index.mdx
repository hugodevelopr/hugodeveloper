# Deep Dives

Deep Dives are where I go beyond “how” and explain **why**.

This is for readers who care about the uncomfortable parts:
- what breaks
- what costs money
- what slows teams down
- what creates incident risks
- what trade-offs were chosen intentionally

## What a deep dive includes

- A **system model** (how data and control flow through the system)
- **Failure modes** and recovery strategies
- **Trade-offs** with alternatives considered
- Performance and scalability notes (when relevant)
- Observability and operability: what to measure and why

## Recommended reading flow

- Start with a deep dive
- Jump to a related **Decision** record to see the “why”
- Use **Reference** to fill conceptual gaps
- Use **Guides** to implement
