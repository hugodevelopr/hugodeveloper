# Start Here

This site is my public engineering notebook.

I write about building resilient backend systems and making architecture decisions that survive real-world constraints — **performance, reliability, operability, and team velocity** — while staying **hands-on** on the code.

If you’re a recruiter, you’ll find clear signals of scope, trade-offs, and execution.
If you’re an engineer, you’ll find pragmatic patterns, deep dives, and decision records.

## How this site is structured

- **Guides** → actionable “how-to” content you can apply immediately.
- **Deep Dives** → long-form breakdowns (failure modes, trade-offs, scaling, operability).
- **Reference** → evergreen notes: concepts, definitions, and patterns.
- **Decisions** → public decision records (mini-ADRs): what I chose, why, and what I rejected.

Use **Docs** when you want structured knowledge. Use **Blog** when you want opinions, lessons learned, or narrative.

## What to read first

If you only read one thing, start with:

- **Deep Dives** → `/docs/02-deep-dives`
- **Decisions** → `/docs/06-decisions`

If you want “copy/paste-to-work” value:

- **Guides** → `/docs/01-guides`

If you want clear mental models:

- **Reference** → `/docs/03-reference`

## My content standards (so you know what to expect)

Every serious article aims to include:

- **Problem framing**: what we’re solving, what matters, what doesn’t.
- **Constraints**: scale, latency, compliance, runtime/infra constraints.
- **Trade-offs**: what we gain and what we pay.
- **Failure modes**: how this breaks and how to detect it.
- **Operational concerns**: logging, tracing, metrics, rollout strategy.
- **Pragmatism**: implementation details that survive production.

## How I recommend using this site

### For recruiters
Scan:
1) `/docs/02-deep-dives` (scope + reasoning)  
2) `/docs/06-decisions` (judgment + trade-offs)  
3) `/blog` (communication + ownership)

### For engineers
Pick a problem you’re facing and start in **Guides**, then go deeper:
- Guide → Deep Dive → Decision → Reference
